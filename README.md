## Project Overview

This project is a coding exercise for the "Machine Learning with Python" course on Udemy. It demonstrates the application of various machine learning concepts using Python. The project includes several Python scripts that cover different topics in machine learning, such as data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website. Additionally, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the datasets used in the exercises.
- `src/`: This directory contains the Python scripts for the exercises.

Each Python script corresponds to a specific topic in machine learning and includes comments explaining the code.

## Running the Scripts

To run a script, navigate to the `src/` directory and run the Python script using the Python command. For example, to run the script for linear regression, you would use the following command:

```bash
python linear_regression.py
```

## Contributing

This is a coding exercise for a course, and is not open for contribution. However, you're welcome to fork the repository and use the code as a reference for your own projects.
